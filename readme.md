# README

This application was used for gathering data for my bachelor thesis. The subject was "open source software communities under management". This tool queries the Openhub API for lots of information on projects. The structure is pretty weird, as it was constantly being run and then updated. If you're interested in the workings, please contact me (Sije Harkema) via some email you'll find somewhere on the internet, possibly on my Github profile. On it's own it will probably not make any sense, but it might have some good starting points for you.
